1/11/2021,Causal Augmentation for Causal Sentence Classification,First Workshop on Causal Inference and NLP,"Scarcity of annotated causal texts leads to poor robustness when training state-of-the-art language models for causal sentence classification. In particular, we found that models misclassify on augmented sentences that have been negated or strengthened with respect to its causal meaning. This is worrying since minor linguistic differences in causal sentences can have disparate meanings. Therefore, we propose the generation of counterfactual causal sentences by creating contrast sets (Gardner et al., 2020) to be included during model training. We experimented on two model architectures and predicted on two out-of-domain corpora. While our strengthening schemes proved useful in improving model performance, for negation, regular edits were insufficient. Thus, we also introduce heuristics like shortening or multiplying root words of a sentence. By including a mixture of edits when training, we achieved performance improvements beyond the baseline across both models, and within and out of corpus’ domain, suggesting that our proposed augmentation can also help models generalize.","Fiona Anting Tan, Devamanyu Hazarika, See-Kiong Ng, Soujanya Poria, and Roger Zimmermann.

1/8/2021,NUS-IDS at CASE 2021 Task 1: Improving Multilingual Event Sentence Coreference Identification With Linguistic Information,4th Workshop on Challenges and Applications of Automated Extraction of Socio-political Events from Text (CASE 2021),"Event Sentence Coreference Identification (ESCI) aims to cluster event sentences that refer to the same event together for information extraction. We describe our ESCI solution developed for the ACL-CASE 2021 shared tasks on the detection and classification of socio-political and crisis event information in a multilingual setting. For a given article, our proposed pipeline comprises of an accurate sentence pair classifier that identifies coreferent sentence pairs and subsequently uses these predicted probabilities to cluster sentences into groups. Sentence pair representations are constructed from fine-tuned BERT embeddings plus POS embeddings fed through a BiLSTM model, and combined with linguistic-based lexical and semantic similarities between sentences. Our best models ranked 2nd, 1st and 2nd and obtained CoNLL F1 scores of 81.20%, 93.03%, 83.15% for the English, Portuguese and Spanish test sets respectively in the ACL-CASE 2021 competition.","Fiona Anting Tan, Sujatha Das Gollapalli, and See-Kiong Ng. 2021.

1/6/2022,The Causal News Corpus: Annotating Causal Relations in Event Sentences from News,13th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference,"Despite the importance of understanding causality, corpora addressing causal relations are limited. There is a discrepancy between existing annotation guidelines of event causality and conventional causality corpora that focus more on linguistics. Many guidelines restrict themselves to include only explicit relations or clause-based arguments. Therefore, we propose an annotation schema for event causality that addresses these concerns. We annotated 3,559 event sentences from protest event news with labels on whether it contains causal relations or not. Our corpus is known as the Causal News Corpus (CNC). A neural network built upon a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model performed well with 81.20% F1 score on test set, and 83.46% in 5-folds cross-validation. CNC is transferable across two external corpora: CausalTimeBank (CTB) and Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Leveraging each of these external datasets for training, we achieved up to approximately 64% F1 on the CNC test set without additional fine-tuning. CNC also served as an effective training and pre-training dataset for the two external corpora. Lastly, we demonstrate the difficulty of our task to the layman in a crowd-sourced annotation exercise. Our annotated corpus is publicly available, providing a valuable resource for causal text mining researchers.","Fiona Anting Tan, Ali Hürriyeto˘glu, Tommaso Caselli, Nelleke Oostdijk, Tadashi Nomoto, Hansi Hettiarachchi, Iqra Ameer, Onur Uca, Farhana Ferdousi Liza, and Tiancheng Hu. 2022.

15/9/2021,NUS-IDS at FinCausal 2021: Dependency Tree in Graph Neural Network for Better Cause-Effect Span Detection,3rd Financial Narrative Processing Workshop,"Automatic identification of cause-effect spans in financial documents is important for causality modelling and understanding reasons that lead to financial events. To exploit the observation that words are more connected to other words with the same cause-effect type in a dependency tree, we construct useful graph embeddings by incorporating dependency relation features through a graph neural network. Our model builds on a baseline BERT token classifier with Viterbi decoding (Kao et al., 2020), and outperforms this baseline in cross-validation and during the competition. In the official run of FinCausal 2021, we obtained Precision, Recall, and F1 scores of 95.56%, 95.56% and 95.57% that all ranked 1st place, and an Exact Match score of 86.05% which ranked 3rd place.","Fiona Anting Tan and See-Kiong Ng. 2021.
