1/11/2021,Causal Augmentation for Causal Sentence Classification,First Workshop on Causal Inference and NLP,"Scarcity of annotated causal texts leads to poor robustness when training state-of-the-art language models for causal sentence classification. In particular, we found that models misclassify on augmented sentences that have been negated or strengthened with respect to its causal meaning. This is worrying since minor linguistic differences in causal sentences can have disparate meanings. Therefore, we propose the generation of counterfactual causal sentences by creating contrast sets (Gardner et al., 2020) to be included during model training. We experimented on two model architectures and predicted on two out-of-domain corpora. While our strengthening schemes proved useful in improving model performance, for negation, regular edits were insufficient. Thus, we also introduce heuristics like shortening or multiplying root words of a sentence. By including a mixture of edits when training, we achieved performance improvements beyond the baseline across both models, and within and out of corpus’ domain, suggesting that our proposed augmentation can also help models generalize.","Fiona Anting Tan, Devamanyu Hazarika, See-Kiong Ng, Soujanya Poria, and Roger Zimmermann.

1/8/2021,NUS-IDS at CASE 2021 Task 1: Improving Multilingual Event Sentence Coreference Identification With Linguistic Information,4th Workshop on Challenges and Applications of Automated Extraction of Socio-political Events from Text (CASE 2021),"Event Sentence Coreference Identification (ESCI) aims to cluster event sentences that refer to the same event together for information extraction. We describe our ESCI solution developed for the ACL-CASE 2021 shared tasks on the detection and classification of socio-political and crisis event information in a multilingual setting. For a given article, our proposed pipeline comprises of an accurate sentence pair classifier that identifies coreferent sentence pairs and subsequently uses these predicted probabilities to cluster sentences into groups. Sentence pair representations are constructed from fine-tuned BERT embeddings plus POS embeddings fed through a BiLSTM model, and combined with linguistic-based lexical and semantic similarities between sentences. Our best models ranked 2nd, 1st and 2nd and obtained CoNLL F1 scores of 81.20%, 93.03%, 83.15% for the English, Portuguese and Spanish test sets respectively in the ACL-CASE 2021 competition.","Fiona Anting Tan, Sujatha Das Gollapalli, and See-Kiong Ng. 2021.

15/9/2021,NUS-IDS at FinCausal 2021: Dependency Tree in Graph Neural Network for Better Cause-Effect Span Detection,3rd Financial Narrative Processing Workshop,"Automatic identification of cause-effect spans in financial documents is important for causality modelling and understanding reasons that lead to financial events. To exploit the observation that words are more connected to other words with the same cause-effect type in a dependency tree, we construct useful graph embeddings by incorporating dependency relation features through a graph neural network. Our model builds on a baseline BERT token classifier with Viterbi decoding (Kao et al., 2020), and outperforms this baseline in cross-validation and during the competition. In the official run of FinCausal 2021, we obtained Precision, Recall, and F1 scores of 95.56%, 95.56% and 95.57% that all ranked 1st place, and an Exact Match score of 86.05% which ranked 3rd place.","Fiona Anting Tan and See-Kiong Ng. 2021.

1/6/2022,The Causal News Corpus: Annotating Causal Relations in Event Sentences from News,13th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference,"Despite the importance of understanding causality, corpora addressing causal relations are limited. There is a discrepancy between existing annotation guidelines of event causality and conventional causality corpora that focus more on linguistics. Many guidelines restrict themselves to include only explicit relations or clause-based arguments. Therefore, we propose an annotation schema for event causality that addresses these concerns. We annotated 3,559 event sentences from protest event news with labels on whether it contains causal relations or not. Our corpus is known as the Causal News Corpus (CNC). A neural network built upon a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model performed well with 81.20% F1 score on test set, and 83.46% in 5-folds cross-validation. CNC is transferable across two external corpora: CausalTimeBank (CTB) and Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB). Leveraging each of these external datasets for training, we achieved up to approximately 64% F1 on the CNC test set without additional fine-tuning. CNC also served as an effective training and pre-training dataset for the two external corpora. Lastly, we demonstrate the difficulty of our task to the layman in a crowd-sourced annotation exercise. Our annotated corpus is publicly available, providing a valuable resource for causal text mining researchers.","Fiona Anting Tan, Ali Hürriyetoglu, Tommaso Caselli, Nelleke Oostdijk, Tadashi Nomoto, Hansi Hettiarachchi, Iqra Ameer, Onur Uca, Farhana Ferdousi Liza, and Tiancheng Hu. 2022.

1/12/2022,"Event Causality Identification with Causal News Corpus - Shared Task 3, CASE 2022",5th Workshop on Challenges and Applications of Automated Extraction of Socio-political Events from Text (CASE),"The Event Causality Identification Shared Task of CASE 2022 involved two subtasks working on the Causal News Corpus. Subtask 1 required participants to predict if a sentence contains a causal relation or not. This is a supervised binary classification task. Subtask 2 required participants to identify the Cause, Effect and Signal spans per causal sentence. This could be seen as a supervised sequence labeling task. For both subtasks, participants uploaded their predictions for a held-out test set, and ranking was done based on binary F1 and macro F1 scores for Subtask 1 and 2, respectively. This paper summarizes the work of the 17 teams that submitted their results to our competition and 12 system description papers that were received. The best F1 scores achieved for Subtask 1 and 2 were 86.19{\%} and 54.15{\%}, respectively. All the top-performing approaches involved pre-trained language models fine-tuned to the targeted task. We further discuss these approaches and analyze errors across participants{'} systems in this paper.","Fiona Anting Tan, Hansi Hettiarachchi, Ali Hürriyeto ̆glu, Tommaso Caselli, Onur Uca, Farhana Ferdousi Liza, and Nelleke Oostdijk. 2022.

19/7/2023,Constructing and Interpreting Causal Knowledge Graphs from News.,AAAI Summer Symposium on AI for FinTech,"Many jobs rely on news to learn about causal events in the past and present, to make informed decisions and predictions about the future. With the ever-increasing amount of news and text available on the internet, there is a need to automate the extraction of causal events from unstructured texts. In this work, we propose a methodology to construct causal knowledge graphs (KGs) from news using two steps: (1) Extraction of Causal Relations, and (2) Argument Clustering and Representation into KG. We aim to build graphs that emphasize on recall, precision and interpretability. For extraction, although many earlier works already construct causal KGs from text, most adopt rudimentary pattern-based methods. We close this gap by using the latest BERT-based extraction models alongside pattern-based ones. As a result, we achieved a high recall, while still maintaining a high precision. For clustering, we utilized a topic modelling approach to cluster our arguments, so as to increase the connectivity of our graph. As a result, instead of 15,686 disconnected subgraphs, we were able to obtain 1 connected graph that enables users to infer more causal relationships from. Our final KG effectively captures and conveys causal relationships, validated through multiple use cases and user feedback.","Fiona Anting Tan, Debdeep Paul, Sahim Yamaura, Miura Koji, and See-Kiong Ng. 2023c.

28/8/2023,UniCausal: Unified Benchmark and Model for Causal Text Mining,Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery (DaWaK),"Current causal text mining datasets vary in objectives, data coverage, and annotation schemes. These inconsistent efforts prevented modeling capabilities and fair comparisons of model performance. Few datasets include cause-effect span annotations, which are needed for end-to-end causal extraction. Therefore, we proposed UniCausal, a unified benchmark for causal text mining across three tasks: Causal Sequence Classification, Cause-Effect Span Detection and Causal Pair Classification. We consolidated and aligned annotations of six high quality human-annotated corpus, resulting in a total of 58,720, 12,144 and 69,165 examples for each task respectively. Since the definition of causality can be subjective, our framework was designed to allow researchers to work on some or all datasets and tasks. As an initial benchmark, we adapted BERT pre-trained models to our task and generated baseline scores. We achieved 70.10% Binary F1 score for Sequence Classification, 52.42% Macro F1 score for Span Detection, and 84.68% Binary F1 score for Pair Classification.","Fiona Anting Tan, Xinyu Zuo, and See-Kiong Ng. 2023d.
